In Splunk, we can use the search function to locate information from various logs.

search: index="datasource" earliest=0

We are searching through a specific data source from the earliest data set. We could also use the All Time option on the Data Range list on the left hand side.

We can select a slice of the data by selection 1:100 or 1:1000 etc or use all the data by not filtering.

Once all the data has been loaded, there will be some fields listed by Splunk. We can use these to dig deeper into the data.
