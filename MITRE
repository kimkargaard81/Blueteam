MITRE ATT&CK provides an overview of the techniques used by various APTs and one can use the Attack Navigator to outline the different phases used by a specific APT. 

The different phases of MITRE ATT&CK are:

1. Initial Access

Currently 9 techniques for initial access:

        Drive-by Compromise
        Exploit public-facing application
        External remote services
        Hardware additions
        Phishing
        Replication through removable media
        Supply chain compromise
        Trusted relationship
        Valid accounts

2. Execution

These techniques are used to describe ways that adversaries will execute malicious code for a number of purposes, and at the time of writing currently includes 12 top-level techniques.
 
        Command and Scripting Interpreter
        Container Administration Command
        Deploy Container
        Exploitation for Client Execution
        Inter-Process Communication
        Native API
        Scheduled Task/Job
        Shared Modules
        Software Deployment Tools
        System Services
        User Execution
        Windows Management Instrumentation

Persistence

Once an adversary has access to a system they need to attempt to maintain their foothold by hiding from the defenders and utilising multiple methods to regain access to the compromised host. At the time of writing there are currently 19 high-level techniques for this category. 

        Account Manipulation
        BITS jobs

        Boot or Logon Initialisation Scripts

        Compromise Client Software Binary
        Create Account
        Create or Modify System Process
        Event Triggered Execution
        External Remote Services
        Hijack Execution Flow
        Implant Internal Image
        Modify Authentication Process
        Office Application Startup
