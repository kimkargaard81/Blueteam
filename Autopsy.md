To start, click on the Web History near the bottom. This will show us the sites that have been visited on the system including the date accessed, the page title if available, and the program that was used to access the web resource. 

This is a great way to view the browsing habits and sites accessed by a suspect. Timestamps also help us to create a timeline of events that have occurred and can be used to prove that a user visited resources on a particular day, which could aid an investigation.

Now let’s see what files the user has deleted by going to the Recycle Bin in the navigation tree. On the right pane we can now see that the user has deleted three files, and we’re given their file paths, the user that deleted them, and the time the file was deleted. This can be a quick-win if we’re looking to identify files that have been deleted and gain information about them.

We can actually export these files to look at them (this isn’t limited to files in the recycle bin, we can actually do this with any files identified in the disk image!). Right click the path for “Underage_lolita_r@ygold_001.jpg” 

Moving on, let’s take a look at the Installed Programs section to identify what software has been installed on this system. Left-click on the heading, and on the right pane we can now see a list of installed programs. From here we can determine when programs were installed and their names, with some entries including WinRAR, GIMP, WinZIP, and Google Chrome.

Let’s go through one more section together, “Accounts > Email” right at the bottom of the navigation tree. Here we can see a list of email files that were downloaded to the system, typically through an email client.

Now that you understand how to export file by right-clicking, let’s export the highlighted email file and take a look (you’ll need an email client if you want to view it as the sender and recipient would see it, such as Mozilla Thunderbird or Microsoft Outlook App. Alternatively you can read the contents by opening the email with a text editor).


Reading a suspects emails could help to collect evidence regarding the case for a legal investigation, or for incident response purposes we could look to identify malicious emails that were present on the system around the time of the compromise. We could then analyse these to collect indicators such as:

Email Sender
Email Recipient
Date and Time
Subject Line
Sending Server IP
and more!
