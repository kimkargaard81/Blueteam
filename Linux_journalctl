Checking the logs for a specific service:

journalctl | grep -i ftp | less

Checking the /tmp dir to see if there have been any files placed there:

journalctl | grep -i /tmp

If we want to find all the activity from a malicious actor with a known username and IP address

journalctl | grep username | grep "IP\.IP\.IP\.IP"

eg: journalctl | grep ftpadam | grep "110\.44\.125\.139"
